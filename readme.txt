== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the chord shortcode? =

The syntax is simple: [chord NOTE (QUALITY)]
To add chords to any song lyrics, just use the [chord] shortcode before any syllable you would like a chord notation to be placed above.  For example, instead of writing like this:
**Old way:**
`
G7           C    Fsus       C
This is my story, this is my song`

With this plugin, you would write it like this:
**Example:**
`[chord g 7]This is my [chord c]story, [chord f sus] this is my [chord c] song`

= What are the other shortcodes? =

* `[kcn_buttons layout="vertical"]` (vertical,horizontal)
* `[kcn_buttons size="xs"]` (xs,sm,md,lg)
* `[key]` to be placed at the top of a page
Syntax: `[key KEY (QUALITY)]`
*Examples*:
`[key c minor]` = Key of C minor
`[key cb]` = Key of C♭
`[key d#]` = Key of D#
